  <h3>Javascript</h3>
  <p>
    
    <strong>OVERVIEW</strong>:
    
    JavaScript is an interpreted language that became popular with Web
    developers for creating interactive, dynamic Web pages. It's popularity
    continues to grow as it finds its uses on the server side and
    database applications. This module focuses on JavaScript's role
    in the Web browser. Other modules will focus on other uses of
    JavaScript.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    
    On the browser, JavaScript allows to create programs that run as part
    of a Web page. JavaScript can be either embedded within a Web page
    or downloaded as a separate JavaScript file referenced by the Web page.
    Either way the JavaScript code generally pertains to that one Web page.
    The intent is for the JavaScript code to take programmatic control of
    the Web page and respond to user gestures and dynamically manipulate
    the Web page by adding, removing, or changing the DOM of the Web page
    according to pre-programmed JavaScript code. For instance, JavaScript
    can be used to validate forms the user is filling out, giving immediate
    feedback whether the data is valid or not by highlighting form elements,
    showing or hiding icons or alert boxes.

<h4>Intro to JavaScript</h4>

<p>
  JavaScript can be embedded in an HTML document by using the <code>script</code>
  element. Usually the <code>script</code> element goes in the <code>head</code>
  element, but it can appear anywhere in the HTML document and there can be any
  number of <code>script</code> elements. It is common to declare 
  <code>script</code> elements at the end of the <code>body</code> element
  to improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization) performance, and page rendering
  performance. Within the <code>script</code> we can embed JavaScript code such
  as variables, arrays, objects, loops, branching, and functions.
</p>

<p>
  Declare variables using the <code>var</code> keyword as shown below:
</p>

<pre>
var a = 2;
var b = 4;
var c = 2 + 4;
alert(c);</pre>

       Variables &raquo;
</a>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>
  Use the <code>for</code> keyword to implement for loops.
  The code below uses a for loop to calculate the factorial
  of 5:
</p>

<pre>
var fact = 1;
for(var i=1; i<=5; i++)
{
  fact = fact * i;
}
alert("Factorial of 5 = " + fact);</pre>

       Loops &raquo;
</a>

<br/>
<br/>

<p>
  Use the square brackets to declare and initialize arrays.
  The code below finds the minimum and maximum of an array.
</p>

<pre>
var arr = [12,89,54,23,45,78,90,76,54,43];
var min = arr[0];
var max = arr[0];
for(var j=0; j<arr.length; j++)
{
  if(arr[j] > max)
    max = arr[j];
  if(arr[j] < min)
    min = arr[j];
}
alert("Min: " + min);
alert("Max: " + max);</pre>

<h4>The JavaScript Document Object</h4>  

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1673571/sp/167357100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/22492681/partner_id/1673571?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_pk5jvxd0&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;&wid=1_jm6juqsq" width="720" height="486" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
  When you type a URL in a browser address field,
  the browser makes an HTTP GET request to a server
  that's listening for these types of requests.
  Usually the request refers to or resolves to
  some HTML document. The server responds by
  streaming the document back to the browser.
  The browser downloads the document into its
  file cache and parses it into its memory.
  The document is parsed into an object representation
  of the document referred to as the DOM or
  Document Object Model. The DOM has an object
  representation of everything that is rendered
  on the page including the text, font, colors,
  layout, and white spaces in between. The DOM
  is the browser's interpretation of the plain
  text HTML document that is downloaded. Whereas
  the HTML might have syntax errors or missing
  elements, improper nesting, missing closing
  tags, the DOM is the interpretation of the text
  into a proper object representation of the page.
</p>

<p>    
  With JavaScript, it is possible to programmatically
  query, interact, and manipulate the DOM. Any
  modifications to the DOM are reflected onto the
  page. By changing the DOM, JavaScript can dynamically
  change what is displayed in the browser. The
  HTML page is available through JavaScript through
  an object called <code>document</code>. Through the
  <code>document</code> object we can use JavaScript
  to remove or add elements, change element's properties
  such as background color, font, padding and margins.

<h4>Getting Elements by Id</h4>  

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1673571/sp/167357100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/22492681/partner_id/1673571?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_ovkehej0&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;&wid=1_9wj8ob5s" width="720" height="486" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
  
  Use JavaScript's <code>getElementById</code> to get a hold
  of a particular HTML element identified by it's <code>ID</code>
  attribute. First use the <code>ID</code> attribute to
  uniquely identify an element. For instance the code below
  identifies a text field as the <code>firstName</code> text field:
  
</p>

<pre>
&lt;input id=&quot;firstName&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>
  
  The following code retrieves the text field by its ID and
  stores a reference to it in the <code>firstNameField</code>
  variable:
  
</p>

<pre>
var firstNameField = document.getElementById("firstName");</pre>

<input id="firstName"/>

<br/>

<p>
  
  Once we have a reference to an element in the DOM, we can
  invoke various methods on them to apply style changes
  and behaviours. For instance, we can use the <code>value</code>
  attribute to set the text field's value.
  
</p>

<pre>
var firstNameField = document.getElementById("firstName");
firstNameField.value = "Alice";</pre>

<script>
  var firstNameField = document.getElementById("firstName");
  firstNameField.value = "Alice";
</script>

<h4>JavaScript OnClick Event</h4>

<p>

  HTML elements provide various attributes that allow
  binding user gestures to behaviours. Some mouse
  related gestures include:
  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>onclick</li>
  <li>ondblclick</li>
  <li>ondrag</li>
  <li>onmousedown</li>
  <li>onmouseover</li>
</ul> 

<p>
  
  You can capture gestures applied to the window itself:
  
</p>

<ul>
  <li>onload - triggered when the document completes loading.
    This is useful to trigger an initialization script that
    can then take control of the page. The initialization
    script is then guaranteed that the entire page has
    been parsed and the DOM is ready for manipulation. 
  </li>
  <li>onunload - triggered when you close navigate away
    from the page, you close the browser tab or quit the browser
    alltogether. This is useful to trigger scripts that
    clean up before leaving, or unsaved changes.
  </li>
  <li>onresize - triggered when the browser window is resized.
    This is useful for triggering scripts that react to the
    size of the window and might do some complex page layout.
    This would complement (not replace) responsive layout
    that can already be achieved with CSS declarative rules.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>JSON - JavaScript Object Notation</h4>  

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1673571/sp/167357100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/22492681/partner_id/1673571?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_wgkiorpu&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;&wid=1_1so83e05" width="720" height="486" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

<br/>

<p>
  In JavaScript, data is represented using JSON or JavaScript Object Notation.
  JSON has become a very popular format for representing and sharing data in
  Web applications. JSON can be used to represent data to be displayed on the
  page, data collected from a form, data sent to/from a server, or the entire
  page itself. JSON is a simple notation for representing data of varying
  degrees of complexity combining JavaScript primitive data types, arrays,
  named properties, and nested data structures. Below is an example JSON
  object representing an employee:
</p>

<pre>
var alice = {
  "firstName" : "Alice",
  "lastName"  : "Wonderland",
  "ssn"       : "321-32-1234",
  "salary"    : 32132.12,
  "dob"       : new Date(1967,07,07)
};</pre>

<p>
  The variable <code>alice</code> is set to a literal object that contains
  5 properties: <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>ssn</code>,
  <code>salary</code>, and <code>dob</code>. Each of the properties has
  a literal value of different primitive types, e.g., <code>firstName</code>
  refers to the literal string <code>Alice</code>, the <code>salary</code>
  property refers to the number literal <code>32132.12</code>, and
  the <code>dob</code> property has the literal date object instance.
</p>

<p>
  The prorties in <code>alice</code> can be accessed by using the dot notation.
  For instance the code below gives <code>alice</code> a 10% raise:
</p>

<pre>
alice.salary = alice.salary * 1.1;</pre>

<h4>JavaScript Source Files</h4>

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1673571/sp/167357100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/22492681/partner_id/1673571?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_1mi5r7f6&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;&wid=1_tptrskqa" width="720" height="486" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
  JavaScript can be declared and embedded within HTML documents, but
  it is usually a better idea to declare the scripts outside of the
  document and then load them separately by refering to them using
  the <code>src</code> attribute of the <code>script</code> element.
</p>

<p>
  The browser makes separate HTTP requests for every resource referred
  to in the HTML document. For instance, images, CSS files, and JavaScript
  source files are loaded when referred to from the refering HTML document.
  Declaring resources outside of the HTML document increments their
  reusability. Various documents can use the same set of resources.
  The code below loads three common JavaScript source files used throughout
  the course.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.5/angular.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;js/index.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>
  The first three <code>script</code> elements load three common JavaScript
  libraries used throughout this course: jQuery, AngularJS, and Bootstrap.
  The last script, <code>index.js</code>, is downloaded from the same server
  where the HTML document is being downloaded.
  The remote scripts are loaded from remote servers in separate HTTP GET requests.
  These scripts could have been copied
  onto the local server and then downloaded from there instead of the remote
  server. Although this might seem safer, it actually is not. The servers
  from which they are downloaded from are special repositories called CDNs or
  Content Delivery Networks that are
  "guaranteed" to be available, perhaps even more available than our local
  servers, but if our server is not available, neither will the enclosing HTML
  document be available :) Scripts hosted in CDNs also have a performance
  advantage over local scripts. Since these are well known URLs, developers of
  various other sites tend to use them often as well. Browsers that have
  visited these other sites will cache them locally and not re-download them
  when they get to our site.

<h4>JavaScript Name Spaces</h4>

<iframe id="kaltura_player" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1673571/sp/167357100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/22492681/partner_id/1673571?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_mro3vh1l&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;&wid=1_7rx2qwla" width="720" height="486" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
  Downloading scripts from various sources and from different vendors
  is a very powerful feature that allows developers to quickly enhance
  Web site behaviours. There are although potential pitfals. When
  a JavaScript source is downloaded it is immediately executed. If a
  source file declares variables and functions, these are made available
  in the global namespace. They can be readily invoked from anywhere
  in other scripts. If we download scripts from various places, it is
  possible that different scripts declare variables or functions with
  the same name creating a name space collision. Scripts loaded
  last can potentially re-declare names declared by earlier scripts.
</p>

<p>

  Namespace collition can be easily avoided by creating a namespace
  using a common JavaScript design pattern: Immediately-Invoked
  Function Expressions or IIFE. To create a namespace wrap your
  code within an IIFE as shown below:
    
</p>

<pre>
(function(){

  /* your code */

})();</pre>
