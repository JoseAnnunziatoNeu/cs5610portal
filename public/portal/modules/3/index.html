  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

    <p>
      Up to this point we have been creating static content, focusing
      on how to layout and organize a Web page. Much of the appealing
      aspects of the Web in general is its ability to interact with us
      and respond appropriately as we engage in dialogs with appealing
      user interfaces. To achieve dynamic interfaces we will explore
      several programmatic techniques that all rely on an underlying
      common language: JavaScript.
    </p>

    <br/>
    
    <p>
      We will first explore some of the inherent, out of the box features
      of JavaScript, but will quickly move on to several popular libraries
      and frameworks built on the language. JQuery and AngularJS have
      become two of the most popular JavaScript libraries. JQuery creates
      an abstraction of the browser to better deal with discrepancies
      across browsers and provide a consistent model and behavior of
      the DOM. AngularJS enforces several best practices and design
      patterns that have already proven successful in enterprise
      application development.

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>
  JavaScript is a programming language that allows programmatic
  control of the browser, event handling, network communication
  and dynamic manipulation of the Web page. JavaScript will allow
  us to create dynamic Web pages that handle user gestures,
  retrieve data from server side resources and respond with
  dynamic, interactive user interfaces.

<h3>JQuery</h3>
<p>
  JQuery is a very popular JavaScript library that abstracts
  various browsers by hiding their specific beharious, versions,
  and language discrepancies, and providing a consistent API
  that behaves consistently across browsers. JQueryUI is a set
  of UI widgets and effects built on jQuery that extend the
  behaviours of regular HTML elements. JQueryUI makes it easy
  to create highly interactive UI that enhance the user experience.
