  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

    <p>
      Up to this point we have been creating static content, focusing
      on how to layout and organize a Web page. Much of the appealing
      aspects of the Web in general is its ability to interact with us
      and respond appropriately as we engage dialogs with appealing
      user interfaces. To achieve dynamic interfaces we will explore
      several programmatic techniques that all rely on an underlying
      common language: JavaScript.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We wil first explore some of the inherent, out of the box features
      of JavaScript, but will quickly move on to several popular libraries
      and frameworks built on the language. JQuery and AngularJS have
      become two of the most popular JavaScript libraries. JQuery creates
      an abstraction of the browser to better deal with discrepancies
      across browsers and provide a consistent model and behavior of
      the DOM. AngularJS enforces several best practices and design
      patterns that have already proven successful in enterprise
      application development.
