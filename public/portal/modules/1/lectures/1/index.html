  <h3>Setting Up Github</h3>
  <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: GitHub is a free web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. In this video,   we will go through the steps to set up Node.js in your machine.</p>

<h3>Git</h3>

<p>
  Git is a distributed version control system originally
  introduced in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the same Linus
  who gave us Linux back in 1991. Git emphasizes speed
  and the ability to work distributedly. Instead of having
  a centralized code repository, every Git working directory
  is a full copy of a code repository with the whole
  complete history of code changes. Developers generally
  agree on one of these repositories as the master
  repositories from where they can all share the same
  code base.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>
  Git's official web site is
  
  <a href="https://git-scm.com">
    https://git-scm.com
  </a>.
  
  There you will find extensive
  
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc">
    documentation
  </a>,
  
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">
    books
  </a>,
  
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/videos">
    and tutorial videos
  </a>.
  
  This course will use Git as the source control
  software and will show the exact commands needed
  to use Git. We encourage you to visit Git's
  documentation for a thorough coverage of all the
  commands.
  
  Git will be used to deploy code to an online
  Web hosting service, to submit assignments, to
  retrieve example code, and to share source code
  in general.
</p>

<h3>Install a git client</h3>

<p>
  There are several free git clients for the
  most operating systems. Some provide a graphical
  user interface and most of them also provide
  a command line interface. Regardless of what
  operating system you are using for this course
  we will be using the command line to interact
  with git. If you prefer to use the graphical
  user interface for your particular git client,
  please refer to the documentation on how to
  use the interface. The command line examples
  provided in this course are standard and will
  work the same regardless of your particular
  OS.
</p>

<h4>On Windows</h4>

<p>
  There are several good Git clients for the
  Windows operating system.
  
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">
    We recommend downloading
    the official version.
  </a>
  
  Donwload and run the installer on your machine.
  Make sure to allow installing the command line
  tools that will allow interacting with Git from
  the command line.
</p>

<h4>On Macs, Unix, or Linux Machines</h4>

<p>
  If you have a Mac or a Unix based OS you should
  already have

<h3>Github</h3>

<p>
  <a href="github.com">
    Github.com
  </a>
  
  is a service that allows hosting Git repositories.
  There are several tiers of service that range in
  price. The free version should be plenty for this
  course. It allows creating any number of public
  repositories with any number of developers collaborating
  on the same code repository. Being public anyone
  can see your code and clone it as their own and
  keep working on their own copy. They can't make
  changes to your repository unless invited to do so.
  Since it is open make sure not to include any
  sensitive information that might compromise your
  software systems such as usernames, emails, passwords,
  phone numbers, license keys, etc. If you want the
  repository to be private you'll need to pay for
  their private repository plans.

    <ol>
      <li>Create account in <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github.com</a>.</li>
      <li>Download Git client.</li>
      <li>Create a test repository in Github.com.</li>
      <li>Use terminal to set up local directory.</li>
