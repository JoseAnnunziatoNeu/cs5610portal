      Node.js
    </a>
      
    is an open source, cross platform runtime environment that allows executing
    JavaScript programs on desktop machines. It is commonly used to create server
    side networking applications. In this course Node.js will be used to implement
    HTTP servers that will host HTML content and RESTful Web services.

<h4>1. Installing Node.js</h4>

<p>
  Node.js can be installed on most operating systems. Download the installer for
  your OS from
  
  <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org">
      Node.js
  </a>

  and follow the installer's instructions. The installer will add several executables
  to your path of which two will be used extensively throughout the course:
  <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code>. The <code>node</code> executable is the
  runtime environment that will allow executing JavaScript programs at the consonle.
  The <code>npm</code> executable, which stands for Node Package Manager, will allow
  installing additional Node.js libraries that extend the functionality of Node.js.
  
  Once installation is done test whether
  Node.js has been installed by typing the <code>node</code> command in your
  terminal. Node.js should give you a prompt for more commands. Type <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd>
  to quit. The following video shows steps on how to download, install, and test
  a Node.js installation.

<h5>Hello.js</h5>

<p>
  Once you have installed Node.js you can try out executing simple JavaScript
  programs. Create a file called <code>hello.js</code> with the following content
</p>

<pre>
  console.log("Hello World!");
</pre>

<p>
  To execute the program just type <code>node hello.js</code> at your terminal
  and your program will execute displaying its output in the console.
</p>

<pre>
  > node hello.js
  Hello World!
</pre>

<h4>2. NPM - Node Package Manager</h4>

<p>
  Like many software development frameworks, they are not terribly interesting
  on their own. Where they tipically shine is the extensive set of libraries
  that extend the features of the framework. Node.js has a very active community
  of developers creating an ever growing collection of open source libraries
  that have made the framework very popular. These libraries can easily be
  installed through the use of the <code>npm</code> command or Node Package
  Manager. Npm downloads packages from a repository and installes them locally
  on your machine in the form of modules. The repository is hosted at
  
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a>.
  
  The following video introduces npm and how to use it to install some
  popular packages.
