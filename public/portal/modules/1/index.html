  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

  <p>
    In this course we will be building Web applications.
    Web applications are applications that use various Web
    technologies as building blocks. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    and Angular will be used to build the front directly
    interacting with users. As users interact with the
    Web application they will be generating a sequence of
    HTTP requests directed at a server built on Node.js
    and Express, a popular Node.js library. The server
    will handle the requests and use Mongoose (another
    very popular Node.js library) to store and retrieve
    a data model from MongoDB, a NoSQL database. 
    
    The front end, web services, and data access and storage
    are all hosted and/or configured in a Node.js runtime
    instance.
    
    This module covers Node.js installation and configuration.

    The learning objectives of this modules are
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Share source code with a GitHub source code repository</li>
    <li>Download and install Node.js</li>
    <li>Create, start and stop a simple Node.js HTTP server</li>
    <li>Create, configure, and deploy a Node.js Web application in OpenShift</li>

<h3>
Node.js

<h3>
GIT
</h3>
<p>
  Git is a distributed version control system that will
  allow backing up and sharing code in the course. 
  GitHub is a web-based git repository hosting service
  which offers all of the distributed revision control
  and source code management functionality of git.
  You will use git in this course to submit your assignments.
  You will submit the repository URLs to Blackboard
  and invite the TAs and instructor to your GitHub
  repositories. The TAs and instructor will then be
  able to view the source code and even clone your
  application into their own local repositories to
  replicate an assignment or project.
