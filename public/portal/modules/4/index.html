  <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>

    <p>
        Up to this point we have been working mostly on
        the client, on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript running
        and rendered dynamically on a browser. We have
        been using a Node.js server mostly to just host
        and serve this content when requested from a
        browser. This module will expand on many more
        capabilities of Node.js as middle tier software.

<h3>Creating a Node.js Server</h3>
<p>
    First we'll review installing and configuring Node.js
    as a JavaScript interpreter executing simple JavaScript
    programs. Express.js will be introduced as one of Node.js
    most popular libraries that simplifies the creation of
    middleware. We have already been using to serve up the
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as static content in a public
    directory. This section expands on Node.js and Express.js
    capabilities.

<h3>Web Services</h3>
<p>
    We have been using Node.js and Express.js to host content
    meant for human consumption. That is content such as HTML,
    and CSS is meant for laying out page content meant to be
    read by humans, and styling to please subjective human
    tastes. Express.js can be used for so much more.
    In particular this section covers serving and manipulating
    data through a Web service interacting with a data model
    hosted by the server.
