  <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
  <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: 
        
  The Web development industry has matured enough for design patterns
  and best practices to emerge. There are enough collective best practices
  that they can be grouped into coherent frameworks. Several of these
  frameworks have emerged and become fairly popular amongst the developer
  community.

<p>
  Early on, when HTML and browsers first came out in 1993,
  many realized the ease with which content could be created (HTML)
  and consumed (browsers). With so much content being created
  we quickly discovered both the potential and limits of HTML.
  One of the limitiations was that many concepts from printed
  media did not readily translate to HTML. Particularly laying
  out content horizontally was a challenge. A solution that
  became very popular to 'solve' this 'perceived' limitation
  was to use the HTML <code>table</code> element. Table
  elements allow
  organizing content into rows and columns, from top to bottom
  and left to right. Tables also allow spanning content
  across several columns and rows which allows for some
  interesting layout.
</p>

<p>
  Today using <code>table</code> elements for laying out a page is
  generally considered a bad practice and outright frowned upon.
  Tables elements should be used for their intended purpose
  of displaying tabular data. Instead we rely on other
  techniques to achieve the same effect. Today we use
  CSS to control how content renders side by side using
  CSS properties such as <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code>
