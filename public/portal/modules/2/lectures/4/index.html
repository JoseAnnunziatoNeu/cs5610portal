  <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
  <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong>: 
        
  The Web development industry has matured enough for design patterns
  and best practices to emerge. There are enough collective best practices
  that they can be grouped into coherent frameworks. Several of these
  frameworks have emerged and become fairly popular amongst the developer
  community.

<p>
  Early on, when HTML and browsers first came out in 1993,
  many realized the ease with which content could be created (HTML)
  and consumed (browsers). With so much content being created
  we quickly discovered both the potential and limits of HTML.
  One of the limitiations was that many concepts from printed
  media did not readily translate to HTML. Particularly laying
  out content horizontally was a challenge. A solution that
  became very popular to 'solve' this 'perceived' limitation
  was to use the HTML <code>table</code> element. Table
  elements allow
  organizing content into rows and columns, from top to bottom
  and left to right. Tables also allow spanning content
  across several columns and rows which allows for some
  interesting layout.
</p>

<p>
  Today using <code>table</code> elements for laying out a page is
  generally considered a bad practice and outright frowned upon.
  Tables elements should be used for their intended purpose of
  displaying tabular data. Instead we rely on other techniques
  to achieve the same effect. Today we use CSS to control how
  content renders side by side using CSS properties such as
  <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code>
</p>

<p>
  The industry has been using CSS to layout pages for quite
  a while now and various design patterns and best practices
  have been identified. Many of these techniques have been
  implemented in the last couple of years in an increasing
  pleathora of CSS frameworks. One of these techniques is to
  use a standard set of CSS rules to layout the page into a
  grid system of rows and columns. Essentially achieving the
  same functionality of tables, but implemented as <code>div</code>
  elements with a standard set of <code>row</code> and
  <code>col</code>umn classes. These classes allow

<h4>Bootstrap Forms</h4>

<p>
  Forms allow users to enter data and is the main
  mechanism by which users interact with Web applications.
  Users fill out forms and submit them for processing
  by the server.
</p>

<p>
  Bootstrap provides a comprehensive set of classes
  and HTML templates that makes it easy for a developer
  to create professional, consistent, responsive forms.
  One of the more common classes used throughout this
  course and in the example code is the <code>form-control</code>
  class. Use this class when declaring <code>input</code>
  fields and they will render with rounded corners,
  highlights, and responsive.
</p>

<p>
  Buttons and links are one of the primary mechanisms
  for users to initiate an action such as submitting
  a form, or navigating to another page. Bootstrap has
  an extensive set of classes to style buttons and links.
  Use class <code>btn</code> to style a button or a link
  as a nice looking button. The <code>btn</code> must be
  used in conjunction with one of the following classes
  to style the button with one of several standard look
  and feels:
  <ul>
    <li><button class="btn btn-primary">btn-primary</button></li>
    <li><button class="btn btn-success">btn-success</button></li>
    <li><button class="btn btn-info">btn-info</button></li>
    <li><button class="btn btn-warning">btn-warning</button></li>
    <li><button class="btn btn-danger">btn-danger</button></li>
  </ul>
  
  Add the class <code>btn-block</code> to configure the
  button to render the entire width of the containing
  element. Since this is usually the <code>body</code>
  element, it is useful when implementing mobile applications.
